    *** Array and Array List:

    1. array objects are in heap memory
    2. heap objects are not continuous
    3. DMA (dynamic memory allocation) are there.
    hence, array objects in java (internally) may not be continuos.
    may not be continuous -> it's depends on JVM

    array syntax:
    int[] arr = new int[5];
    arr: arr is reference variable
    new is used to create an object
    creating the objects in the heap memory => runtime

    without new you can write directly in {} within array.
    (internally is doing the same thing as per we did in above explanation)

    ** for the integer array by default value is 0
    ** for the string array by default value is NULL

    NULL : it is a special literal
    we cannot assign in primitive , we assign only in non-primitive like "string"
    [it is compair to NONE with python]

    for string array:
    String[] arr = new String[];

    in java, primitives are stored in the stack memory

    primitives are: int, char, boolean, float.
